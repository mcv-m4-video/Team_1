# G1_M4
####### WEEK 1 #######
The tasks 1,3 and 6 are in main.
The tasks 4, 5 and 7 are in main_kitti.

The usage is only to execute:

>> main;

>> main_kitti;

All will be showed pause after pause.

Except main, all the functions are in the functions folder. We also added the stereo/optical flow development kit of Kitti dataset in devkit_kitti.

The kitti dataset is stored in data_stereo_flow (note that is only stored the data used).
The highway dataset is stored in highway.
In results and results_kitti are stored the results used in this practical session.

Good luck!
